<p id="p1">
The reversing evaluation is required to make account in opposite direction to one of exchange rate difference in invoice processed at the end of previous period.<br/>
It is created in the same way to the exchange rate difference evaluation at the end of the previous period.
<p class="note">
Note:<br/>
-	This entry can not be created/deleted after data closing date/time;<br/>
-	Creating “Reversing Evaluation of Exchange Rate Difference”: search in
 detail payable by invoice in required period/year to find out evaluation records of invoices with payable accounts belonging
  to “List of Exchange Rate Difference Reversing Accounts”, keep these records in the opposite direction (reverse debit
   difference into credit one and vice versa) and save to next period with “Voucher Date” as the first date of the next month;<br/>
-	Only records with “Voucher Date” as the last date of the month are reversed;<br/>
-	Processing: when calculating the remaining amount of invoices in accounting currency in a period (compared with the amount by 
exchange rate revaluation to have the difference), the difference of the reversing evaluation in that period is also used in calculation.</p>
<p class="e">
For example: Invoice HD001 is evaluated at the end of period 1 (having difference 1), reversing evaluation is created at the beginning of period 2 (having difference 2)=> when the invoice is evaluated at the end of period 2, the remaining invoice amount in accounting currency before evaluating must be equal to invoice amount plus difference 1 minus difference 2.</p>

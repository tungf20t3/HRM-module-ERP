<p id="td2">Field descriptions</p>

<p class="node">	Maximum Idle Time</p>
<p class="node_d">
In case an employee has a working shift started on previous day and ended today, maximum idle time will be used to determine 
time out of the previous working shift. The actual time out can only be later than one in detailed shift a period of time equal 
to the maximum idle time. Otherwise, it will be shown in "Employees with Inaccurate Time In/Out" report.</p>

<p class="node">Detailed Shift</p>
<p class="node_d">Detailed shift is used in case there are many times of scanning card in a shift or there is a break at the middle of shift.</p>

<p class="e">For example:<br/>
Regular workday begins at 8:00 and ends at 17:00 and there is an-hour break for lunch. In this case, you have to define 2 detailed 
shifts for this shift.</p>

<p class="node">(Time In/Out) Next Day</p>
<p class="node_d">	This option is selected in case a shift begins on one day and ends on the next day; or a detail of this shift is 
in the next day.<br/>
When getting timekeeping data, the system will recognize that the time in/out on one day of a detailed shift with check on the 
"Next Day" option will be timekeeping data of the previous day.<br/>
In case of time in/out adjusting, the "Next Day" option is checked at "Employee Time In/Out Adjusting" function 
because the system cannot edit the manually input information.
At that time, the date input is the previous date and check on "Next Day" option.</p>

<p class="node">	Minimum Minutes/ Maximum Hours </p>
<p class="node_d">Minimum minutes and maximum hours of detailed shift defined in “Detailed Shift” and “Employee overtime register”.<br/>

- If the calculated “hours” (regular or overtime working) plus “added minutes” is greater than “Maximum Hours”, it will be equal 
to “Maximum Hours”;<br/>
- If the calculated “hours” (regular or overtime working) is less than “Minimum Minutes”, it will be 0 and not be added “Late in, 
early out” minutes or “Added minutes” of this detailed shift.<br/>
The minimum minutes and maximum hours in working shift schedule have higher priority than ones detailed shift. This is used for:<br/>
+ overtime register with detailed shift: regular and overtime working day;<br/>
+ overtime register without detailed shift: overtime working day.</p>


<p class="node">Late In/ Early Out</p>
<p class="node_d"> 
If the actual late in minutes is less than "Late In" minutes defined in this field, the system will consider as not late in 
and vice versa. <br/>
If the actual early out minutes is less than "Early Out" minutes defined in this field, the system will consider as not early out and 
vice versa. </p>

<p class="note">Note: <br/>
Late in/early out minutes is only used to determine if an employee is late in/early out or not. 
The working hours will be calculated by actual time (minus the late in/early out minutes).</p>

<p class="node">Added Minutes</p>
<p class="node_d">This field is used for shifts with the duration shorter than actual one so that these shifts will recorded with 
full hours.</p>
<p class="e">For example:<br/>
As usual, the number of working hours on Saturday is 4. Once all employees are allowed 1-hour early out. 
The Saturday shift (detailed shift) must be defined from 7am to 11am with the "Added Minutes" as 60.</p>

<p class="node">	Workday</p>
<p class="node_d">Workday sign of detailed shift; extracted from Workday Sign List.<br/>
The workday signs with category as "Overtime" (*) will be shown in both 1 – “Regular” and 2 – Overtime working shifts.
</p>

<p class="note">(*) The fact that a workday sign is overtime or not depends on "Workday Type" of that workday sign
(refer to "Category" option in Workday Type List).</p>

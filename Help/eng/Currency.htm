Currency Code / Currency Name/ Other Name
<p class="node_d">
Code of the currency and its name in Vietnamese and English

<p class="node">Realized Loss Account</p>
<p class="node_d">The account recorded in debit (loss from exchange rate difference) in exchange rate difference entries, system-generated due to the decrease entries of accounts having arising and balance in foreign currency. The arising amount that makes asset value (in foreign currency) changed will be recorded in debit side of this account.</p>
<p class="node">Realized Gain Account</p>
<p class="node_d">The account recorded in credit (gain from exchange rate difference) in exchange rate difference entries, system-generated due to the increase entries of accounts having arising and balance in foreign currency. The arising amount that makes asset value (in foreign currency) changed will be recorded in credit side of this account.</p>
<p class="note">Exchange rate differences are considered as vouchers with foreign currency accounts created in period. These differences really make asset value changed while the differences from period-end revaluation only show the value in reports (by creating the difference entries at the end of this period and reversing entries at the beginning of the next period).</p>


<p class="node">Unrealized Loss Account</p>
<p class="node_d">The account recorded in debit (loss from exchange rate revaluation) in exchange rate difference entries, system-generated due to revaluation of account balance in foreign currency at the end of period.</p>
<p class="node">Unrealized Gain Account</p>
<p class="node_d">The account recorded in credit (gain from exchange rate revaluation) in exchange rate difference entries system-generated due to revaluation of account balance in foreign currency at the end of period.
<p class="node">Amount Reading: [1]__[2].[3]__[4]..[5]</p>
<p class="node_d">
- [1] Used in some cases there is of introduction before amount reading. 

<p class="e">For example:<br/> Key in field [1]:"<strong>US dollar: </strong>", 
when printing 1000 USD, it will be " <em> US dollar: One thousand dollars only </em> " in words..<br/>
</p>
<p class="node_d">
- [2] Used to replace currency name.  
<p class="e">
For example: <br/>
The currency name is “US Dollar”, we can replace by “Dollar”, 
when printing 1000 USD, it will be " <em> One thousand dollars only </em> " in words..<br/>
</p>
<p class="node_d">
- [3] Conjunction used to join name of decimal numbers into the main one, usually “and”.
<p class="e">
For example: “One hundred twenty three dollars and forty five cents”</p>

<p class="node_d">
- [4] Unit of decimal amount in accordance with each currency<br/>
- [5] Suffix such as “only”, used in case there is no decimal numbers

<p class="e"> 
 For example:  <br/>When printing 123.45 USD, it will be “ <em> One hundred twenty three dollars and forty five cents</em> ” in words.
 </p>

<p class="node">No. of Decimal Digits</p>
<p class="node_d">Enable to read up to n decimal digits accordance with the required number of decimal digits of each currency.</p>
 <p class="e"> For example: 100 cents=1 dollar; it’s required 2 decimal digits.</p>
<p class="node">In Words / In Words 2</p>
<p class="node_d">The result of trial reading</p>
<p class="note"> Note:<br/>
- In case of the currency without decimal number (like VND), define “No. of Decimal Digits” as 0 and the [5] column as “only”. For example: 10 will be read as “Ten dong only”<br/>
- In case of the currency with decimal numbers (like USD), use 3 or 4 fields. The [2] field is currency name; the [3] one is the conjunction, and the [4] one is unit of decimal number.<br/>
- Some suggestions in definition:</p>

<p id="pic"> <img src="eng/currency3.png"/></p>

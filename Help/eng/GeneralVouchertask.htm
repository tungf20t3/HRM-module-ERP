click to find the voucher "<img src="eng\find.png"/> - Search”, input the quantity and return to the current voucher.</p>

<p class="node">Create lot during voucher entry</p>
<p class="node_d"> If the item is checked in “Lot Control” (in Item List), you can define lot information in this “Lot Maintenance”. 
Besides, lot can be created during data entries of following vouchers:</p>
<ul class="lo_2">
- Domestic Purchase Invoice;<br/>
- Import Purchase Invoice;<br/>
- Purchase Receipt – Direct Issue Voucher;<br/>
- Receipt</ul>
<p class="node_d"> If the item is checked in “Lot Control” and “Allow creating lot when receiving” options (in Item List), 
the system will auto-generate lot code in the format defined in "Automatic Lot Code" parameter to put in the voucher.</p>
<p id="pic"><img src="eng/Lot1.png"/></p>
<p class="node_d">
In voucher entry screen (grid view), click the icon <img src="eng\Lotgenerate.png"/> - “Lot maintenance” to open “Lot maintenance” screen. 
This screen will only show the detail lines of items with "Auto creating lot when receiving" option and the current code of lot is incorrect.
If the “Lot” typed in detail does not exist, the system will auto generate lot code by the rule defined in system parameters. <br/>
Lots are generated by the format defined the “Automatic Lot Code” parameter with 04 special characters “d,m,y,#”:</p>
<ul class="lo_2">
- "d" stands for day;<br/>
- "m" stands for month;<br/>
- "y" stands for year;<br/>
- "#" stands for ordinal number (auto increase in case of multi-lot receiving in a day).</ul>





<p class="node_d">
The character “dmy” must be lower case, if they are in upper case, the system will understand as a part of lot code. </p>
<p class="e">
Example: <br/>We configured the parameter “Automatic Lot Code” as “LO.ddmmyyyy.##” 
In the day Oct 15th 2012 we have 2 receipts, the first one will have lot ID as  “LO.15102012.01”, and the second one will have lot ID as “LO.15102012.02”.</p>
<p class="node_d">Other related information:<br/>
- Receipt Date: being default as voucher date in the first data entry, but editable;<br/>
- Lot Description: system-generated in the form of Lot + lot ID + [Receipt Date] + voucher date, but editable;<br/>
- Manufacturing Date: being default as Receipt Date, but editable;<br/>
- Expiry Date: being equal to "Receipt Date" plus "Shelf Life Days" (if the "Assignment" is "1 - When Received");<br/>
- Warranty Date: being equal to "Receipt Date" plus "Warranty Days", but editable.</p>

<p class="note">Note: <br/>
After you press “OK” in “Lot maintenance” form, a new lot has been created in the list although the voucher has not been saved yet. 
Therefore, when editing an unfinished voucher, you should manually input the created code of lot to avoid creating another code in the system. </p>
<p class="node"> Import data from excel spreadsheet file </p>
<p class="node_d">The system is enabled to import data from excel spreadsheet to save hours of manual effort.</p>

<p class="node">Right in voucher operation</p>
<p class="node_d">The operation in vouchers will also be affected by the authorization by function and unit.</p>
<ul class="lo_2">

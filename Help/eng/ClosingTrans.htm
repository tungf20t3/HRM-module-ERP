<p id="td1">Closing Entry Definition</p>
<p id="p2">Path:                 Modules → General Ledger → Definition → Closing Entry Definition<br/>

At the end of period, we usually make following closing entries:
<ul class="lo_2">
- Closing cost price account to business result account.<br/>
- Closing sales turnover account to business result account.<br/>
- Closing sales expense account to business result account.<br/>
- Closing administration expense account to business result account.<br/>
- …etc.</ul>

<p id="p2">
In case of management detailed in expense and revenue by business type and department, the quantity of closing entries may be very huge. Besides, when you need to have data adjusted, it is required to edit closing entries. So it is waste time if your entries are manually created. <br/>
Because the closing entries above are the same in accounting periods and the data extracting is clear, AI ERP supports auto closing entries.<br/>
For auto closing entries, we have to define “Source” and “Target” account for each entry, define closing from credit account to debit account and vice versa. <br/>
In case closing entries are detailed to customer, job, manufacturing order…, it is required to declare closing by customer, job, MO. <br/>
When processing closing entry, the arising amount in period will be closed and transferred to next period.<br/>
We have some cases in definition:
<ul class="lo_2">
- Closing from a sub-account to another one.<br/>
- Closing from a general account to a sub-account. (Closing from many “Source” sub-accounts to a “Target” sub-account) <br/>
- Closing from a general account to another one. (Closing by couple of “Source & Target” sub-accounts having the same level and “tail” – characters in sub-account belong to parent account) </ul><br/>

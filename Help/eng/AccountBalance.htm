<p id="td1">Account Opening Balance</p>
<p id="p1">
This function is used to input opening balance of account (if any) before using AI ERP. Opening date is the first date of using the system, declared in “Declare the beginning input date”. <br/>
In case the first date of using the system is different to the first date of fiscal year, this function is used to input the year-opening balance of account which will be shown in Balance Sheet articles at year-opening balance column. If the first date of using the system is the same to the first date of fiscal year, the opening balance will be used as year-opening balance to report. <br/>
To AR/AP accounts, year-opening balance can only be input if the first date of using the system is different to the first date of fiscal year. Opening balance can be input in “Customer Opening Balance” or “Supplier Opening Balance” function.<br/>
List of accounts with balance will be system-generated from chart of accounts, unit list. The system will ignore accounts without balance (defined in “List of the first characters of accounts without balance” parameter).</p>

<p id="td2">    Field descriptions</p>
<p id="td3">Format view</p>
<p class="node">Voucher Number</p>
<p class="node_d">Voucher number is system-generated to increase 1 when a new voucher is created; but it is editable.</p>


<p class="node">Voucher Date</p>
<p class="node_d">The date when the voucher is created; for reference only</p>

<p class="node">Posting Date</p>

<p class="node_d">The date when the voucher is posted to GL; be default as voucher date but used in calculation. This field is active only when you click on. Posting date must be after closing date.</p>
<p class="node">Currency</p>

<p class="node">Memo</p>


<p class="node_d">Interpreting content of the current transaction </p>
<p class="note"> Note: For description in account ledgers, description of an account is used for the corresponding account and vice versa. Thus, to record right description of account, remember to reverse the description of 2 accounts in the entry.</p>

<p class="e"> For example:<br/>

We have the corresponding relation between:<br/>

Credit 3348: Salary cost in Nov 2011: 1.000<br/>

Debit 6421-BP 1: Salary cost in Nov 2011- Dept. 1: 200<br/>

Debit 6421-BP 2: Salary cost in Nov 2011- Dept. 2: 400<br/>

Debit 6421-BP 3: Salary cost in Nov 2011- Dept. 3: 400<br/><br/>

Then, description in account ledger 3348 will be:<br/>
Corresponding account 6421-BP 1: Salary cost in Nov 2011- Dept. 1: 200<br/>
Corresponding account 6421-BP 2: Salary cost in Nov 2011- Dept. 2: 400<br/>
Corresponding account 6421-BP 3: Salary cost in Nov 2011- Dept. 3: 400<br/><br/>

Then, description in account ledger 6421 will be:<br/>

Corresponding account 3348: Salary cost in Nov 2011: 200<br/>

Corresponding account 3348: Salary cost in Nov 2011: 400<br/>

</p>
<p class="node"> Import data from excel file</p>
<p class="node_d">
The system is enabled to get data from excel spreadsheet to save hours of manual effort.</p>
<p class="e">
For example: There are only account code, customer ID... in excel file. After importing data from the excel file,

<ul class="lo_2">

	- After keying data in the spreadsheet, to upload data to the system, click the icon <img src="eng/upload.png"/>, 
	select the file, the system will get data from this file to grid view of the voucher.<br/>
</ul>
<p class="note">The system will give error message in some following cases:<br/>

	- Data in columns containing codes of related objects do not exist in current lists (Customer, Account, Job...). 
	In this case, the system will indicate the specific invalid cell;<br/>

<p id="td2">Field descriptions

<p class="node">Account
<p class="node_d">
This account is base to show "Opening Balance" in this report. Job opening balance is the balance of job in this account at the beginning of the first date in "Date from/to" filter condition. Opening balance will be added by the value of increase job articles, subtracted by the value of decrease job articles to have job closing balance. 

<p class="node">"Other" tab - "Calculating Method"
<p class="node_d">There are 2 ways of calculating:
<ul class="lo_2">
1 - Reference: this method is used in case all expenses of jobs have been transferred for job costing. </ul>
<ul class="lo_3">
- In case "Calculating Method" is "1 - Reference" and "Debit/Credit" field in report form declaration is "1 - Debit": the system will get debit of defined accounts which correspond to ones in list of "Reference Account".<br/>
- In case "Calculating Method" is "1 - Reference" and "Debit/Credit" field in report form declaration is "2 - Credit": the system will get credit of defined accounts which correspond to ones in list of "Reference Account".
</ul>
<ul class="lo_2">
2 – Deduction: this method is used in case all expenses of jobs have not been transferred for job costing. </ul>
<ul class="lo_3">
- In case "Calculating Method" is "2 - Deduction" and "Debit/Credit" field in report form declaration is "1 - Debit": the system will get <strong>CREDIT</strong> of defined accounts [A] minus <strong>DEBIT</strong> of the accounts which correspond to ones in list of "Deduction Account"[B].[A]-[B]<br/>
- In case "Calculating Method" is "2 - Deduction" and "Debit/Credit" field in report form declaration is "2 - Credit": the system will get <strong>DEBIT</strong> of defined accounts [A] minus <strong>CREDIT</strong> of the accounts which correspond to ones in list of "Deduction Account"[B].[A]-[B]
</ul>

<p class="e">Fro example:<br/>
Cost of raw materials is defined to get credit of account 621, reference account is 154 (WIP cost) and deduction accounts are 111 (cash), 112 (bank deposit), 152 (raw materials).<br/>
Job VV1 has arising amounts in period as follows: 
debit of 621 corresponding to 152 and 111 are alternately VND 10,000,000 and 50,000,000; 
credit of 621 corresponding to 111 and 152 are alternately VND 3,000,000 and 2,000,000.<br/>
When you have not transferred costs from 621 to 154 for VV1 job costing but you want to view cost of raw materials of this job, select the "Calculating Method" as "2 - Deduction". The cost of raw materials will be:<br/>

10,000,000 + 50,000,000 – 3,000,000 – 2,000,000 = 55,000,000 VND 

<p class="node">Report form definition - "Increase/Decrease" field
<p class="node_d">
This field is base to define that the job article will be added or subtracted in calculating job closing balance. The articles of expenses will be defined as increase and ones of cost reduction will be defined as decrease.

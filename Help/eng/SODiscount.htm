<p id="pic"> <img src="eng/discount.png"/></p>
<p class="node">Discount Type</p>
<p class="node_d">Discount type shows to which discount object/group the discount is applied such as customer, item, site, quantity. There is now an available list of 13 types in the system, un-editable.</p>
<p class="node">Priority</p>
<p class="node_d">Priority information shows if the customer is given many discount types in one same transaction, which one will be applied in priority.</p>
<p class="node">Flat Price Discount</p>
<p class="node_d">This checkbox option, when activated, indicates that discount amount in transaction will be directly extracted from Discount List. So it is required to input the discount amount in Discount Details. If this option is not activated, discount amount will be calculated by discount rate.<br/>
This option is applied only when discount code is one of follows:</p>
<ul class="lo_2">
- Item Code<br/>
- Site Code & Item Code<br/>
- Customer & Item<br/>
- Customer Price Class & Item<br/>
· Applied to Extended Amt.</ul>
<p class="node_d">This checkbox option, when activated, indicates that discount amount is directly deducted on sales price. Then, amount in SO will be calculated by formula:<br/>
Amount=(Standard Unit Price * Quantity) – Discount amount<br/>
If this option is not activated, amount in SO will be calculated by formula:<br/>
Amount=(Standard Unit Price – Discount amount) * Quantity<br/>
Discount amount can be directly input or calculated by discount rate (depending on “Flat Price Discount” option).<br/>
<p class="node">Added Discount</p>
<p class="node_d">This checkbox option, when activated, indicates that in one transaction, the customer is given many types of discount, the 2nd and next discounts will be added to the 1st one if they satisfy the discount condition.<br/>
If it is not activated, the 2nd discount type will not be considered when SO has already been applied the 1st one.</p>
<p class="node">Apply to Remaining</p>
<p class="node_d">This checkbox option, when activated, indicates that in one transaction, the customer is given many types of discount, the 2nd discount type can be applied to the remaining amount after deducting the 1st discount amount (in the priority of discount type). This option is available if “Added Discount” option is activated.<br/>
If this option is not activated, the 2nd discount amount will be calculated in total amount and added to the previous one.</p>
<p class="node">Effective from/ to</p>
<p class="node_d">Effective date shows the period in which the discount is effective. The system will compare this definition with the “Effective to” in Discount Details to calculate discount amount.</p>

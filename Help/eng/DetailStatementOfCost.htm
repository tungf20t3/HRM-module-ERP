<p id="td1">Declaration of Detailed Statement Of Cost
<p id="p1">
It is necessary to estimate cost of a specific product without book closing at the end of month. 
Example, there is a table of planned cost for manufacturing product SPTP01:
<p id="pic"><img src="eng/DetailStatementOfCost.png"/></p> 
<p id="p1">
This table is usually physically calculated so it is not absolutely exact 
(because of the lack of exactness in statistics and selection of cost target or overdue BOM). 
Besides, the targets in this table are usually not stable, so it is difficult to calculate by computer. For example,
 how will cost of product be if there is a cost factor added?! 
 <br/>
In AI ERP, task described above is systemized and carried out in menu “Detailed Statement of Cost”. 

<p id="td2">Process Description
<p id="p2">
Detailed Statement of Cost Process:
<ul class="lo_2">
- Receive SO, consider products having the same properties as products needing to be manufactured;
- After SO created, users consider products with the same BOM as required items; 
<br/>
- Select report date;
<br/>
- Select product in “Filter condition” screen (“Product Code” field);
<br/>
- Click to view;
<br/>
- Edit or add calculating the articles, (add reporting items); 
<br/>
- Input unit price of materials and other expenses;
<br/>
- Save report after printing, click   icon;
<br/>
- Recalculate all, click <img src="eng/refress.png"/>  icon;
<br/>
- Adjust value (BOM or Cost) if necessary to have the best cost table.
</ul>
<p id="td2">Detail for adding report
<p id="p2">
We can add one detailed statement of cost from a similar one by following tasks:
<ul class="lo_2">
- Select products with the same BOM as required items (“Report Form” field); 
<br/>
- Select product in “Filter condition” screen (“Product Code” field);
<br/>
- Click <img src="eng/new.png"/> icon to add a new cost article; Click <img src="eng/edit.png"/>  icon to edit a cost article. 
According to type of article, value is entered in “Classification” field.
</ul>
 <p id="pic"><img src="eng/DetailStatementOfCost1.png"/></p>
<p id="p2">Classification types: 
<p class="node">
0 - Normal
<p class="node_d">Norm in this type can be input value or calculated by other norms;
<p class="node">1 - BOM
<p class="node_d"> used for materials; in case product has bill of materials, these materials will be extracted to detail statement of cost;
<p class="node">
2 - Quantity
<p class="node_d"> Used for quantity norms;
<p class="node">
3 - Unit Cost
<p class="node_d"> Value quantity fields.

<p id="p2"> Besides common target adding, users can have simple calculation by entering in “Formula” field:
<ul class="lo_2">
- Division: CASE WHEN [1010]=0 THEN 0 ELSE [2100] / [1010] END
<br/>
- Round: ROUND (19*[221]/100, 0)   
<br/>
- The calculation targets in formula must be in square brackets ([)
</ul>
<p class="note">
Note:<br/>
- The products which have the same structure and are only different in BOM or in figures entered after making report are grouped into
 1 same Detailed Statement of Cost. Products in the same type are usually grouped together. 
<br/>
- If there is only 1 different cost target, a new report form must be created. Select the same form to create a new one.
<br/>
- It is necessary to create Detailed Statement of Cost (Plan) for materials first. 
Normally, BOM includes raw material cost. If there has not been cost of materials in Detailed 
Statement of Cost (Plan) (effective date of Statement &lt; effective date of BOM), cost will be automatically updated in Statement.

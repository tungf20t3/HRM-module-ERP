<p id="td1">Calculate FA Depreciation</p>
<p id="p1">You calculate fixed asset depreciation monthly and the result will be saved in a data file. If there is any change, you must recalculate depreciation.
<br/>
Depreciation amount is calculated by the system based on the data and formula defined in asset information entry. However, you can edit the amount with “Adjust monthly depreciation" function.

<p id="td2">Descriptions
<p class="node">	Straight-line method<p class="node_d">
For example, depreciated asset code – Fixed asset… calculated by straight-line method. Its original cost is VND 60,000,000 which will be depreciated in 5 year – 60 periods (months).
<br/>
After asset information entry, monthly depreciation will be calculated: depreciation amount of a period is equal to original cost divided by periods=1.000.000VND (=60.000.000/60)
<p class="node">	Quantity method<p class="node_d">
For example, FA depreciation is calculated by quantity, total quantity by capacity is 10.000 m3
<br/>Monthly quantity is 100 m3, so monthly depreciation amount of FA will be: 600.000 (=60.000.000x100/10.000)
<p class="note">
Note:<br/>
When calculating monthly FA depreciation by quantity, you must update quantity of that month in “Fixed Assets Management/Data Entry/Fixed Asset Quantity Input”
<p class="node">	Decreased Balance with Adjustment method<p class="node_d">
To 100% new Asset:<br/>
FA depreciation is calculated by Decreased Balance with Adjustment method. If FA annual depreciation ratio by straight-line method is 20% and adjustment ratio is 2, FA quick depreciation ratio is 40% (20% x 2). FA annual depreciation amount will be shown in following table:

<p id="pic"> <img src="eng/FACalculateDepreciation2.png"/> </p><br/>


<p class="node_d">
FA depreciation amount in 1st to 3rd year is equal to current amount multiplied by quick depreciation ratio (40%).<br/>
In 4th year, depreciation amount calculated by Decreased Balance with Adjustment method=5.184.00 (12.960.000 x 40%) is less than average one of current amount and using year=6.480.000 (=), so FA depreciation amount in the 4th year is equal to current amount divided by using year. 

<p class="node_d">
To Depreciating Asset
<br/>
For example, asset has been calculated depreciation for 18 months before using AI ERP system. To calculate depreciation of this asset by Decreased Balance with Adjustment method, you must define periods and opening depreciation amount in asset information entry.
<br/>Annual depreciation amounts calculated by this method are different, you must define depreciated periods in year and it must be less than 12.
<br/>In this case, opening depreciated periods are 6 (the remainder of calculation 18:12). FA monthly depreciation amount in 2nd year is 1.200.000 so opening depreciation amount is 7.200.000 (1.200.000 x 6).
<br/>Monthly depreciation amount in next 6 months of 2nd year will be 1.200.000.

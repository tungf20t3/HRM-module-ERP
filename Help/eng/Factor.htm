<p id="td1">Cost Factor List</p>
<p id="p1">This is used to define cost factors required for analyzing in product costing.<br/>
Path: Modules → Advanced Costing → List Maintenance → Cost Factor List</p>
<p id="td2">Field descriptions</p><p id="pic"><img src="eng/factor1.png"/></p><br/>
<p class="node">Factor/ Description/ Other Name</p>
<p class="node_d">Cost factor is a basic unit of cost aggregation in cost of product.<br/>
According to an arising of account classified to aggregate cost, a cost factor will be created. If an account is aggregated cost in 2 types, it must be split into 2 sub-accounts and created 2 correlative cost factors. The sub-account in that organization, for using purpose, can be considered as a cost item in Accounting.</p>
 <p class="e"> For example:<br/> 
To “Salary Cost” account, one part is salary of planned working time, one is overtime salary. Both have the same reference account but when other cost factors use salary calculated by planned working time as allocation formula, the account must be split into 2 sub-accounts and created 2 factor codes.</p>
<p class="node">Factor Type</p>
<p class="node_d">Factor type is used to classify cost factors in WIP entry by different finish rate.</p>
 <p class="e"> For example:<br/> ratio of raw material is 100% but that of labor cost is only 50%.</p>
<p class="node">Factor Group</p>
<p class="node_d">According to list setting above, when creating reports, cost factor groups must be defined to group detailed costs into a cost group by original arising. Factor group can be considered as a cost factor in accounting.</p>
 <p class="e">Example:<br/> Raw material cost includes costs of main raw materials and materials used in workshop; or labor cost includes direct/indirect labors, outsourcing or overtime salary…</p>
<p class="node">Factor Style</p>
<p class="node_d">Factor style is used in analyzing, classifying, calculating in program. Factor styles are fixed in 4 options:</p>
<ul class="lo_2">
1 – Raw Material,<br/>
2 – Labor Cost,<br/>
3 – Overheads,<br/>
4 – Others.</ul>
<p class="node">Factor +/-</p>
<p class="node_d">Factor makes cost increase or decrease, fixed in 2 options:</p>
<ul class="lo_2">
1 - Add<br/>
2 - Subtract</ul>
 <p class="e">Example:<br/> Issuing raw materials for manufacturing is cost increase, receiving left or scrap materials is cost decrease.</p>
<p class="node">Debit Accounts/ Credit Accounts/ WIP Account</p>
<p class="node_d">Account definition shows to which cost factor the arising of accounts belongs. Account can be general account.</p>
<p class="node">WIP Closing Balance</p>
<p class="node_d">This checkbox option, if activated, indicates that the cost will be allocated to WIP closing balance of product basing on calculated WIP product quantity. On the contrary, cost factor will be allocated all to production cost in period without consideration of WIP product quantity.<br/>
Closing WIP balance=[Closing WIP quantity converted] * [(Opening WIP balance + Arising in period)/ (Closing WIP quantity converted + Receipt quantity)] </p> 
<p class="node">Gathered by Product</p>
<p class="node_d">This checkbox option, if activated, indicates that cost factor is input by product from data entries. It is usually main raw material factor.<br/>
On the contrary, this factor will be allocated by some formula.</p>
<p class="node">Gathered by Dept.</p>
<p class="node_d">This checkbox option, if activated, indicates that cost factor is input by costing section (direct department) right in data entries.</p>
<p class="node">Gathered by Indirect Dept.</p>
<p class="node_d">Indirect department is used to show this is temporary section of aggregation, cost will be allocated to direct costing sections later.<br/>
This checkbox option, if activated, indicates that cost factor is input by costing section from data entries.</p>
<p class="node">Gathered by MO</p>
<p class="node_d">This checkbox option, if activated, indicates that cost factor is input by manufacturing order from data entries.</p>
<p class="node">Gathered by Material</p>
<p class="node_d">This checkbox option, if activated, indicates that cost factor relates to control by bill of materials.</p><br/>
<p class="note">
Important note:	<br/>
Two options “Indirect Dept.” and “Dept. (Section)” mustn’t be selected both for 1 same factor. A factor can be only considered as direct aggregation or indirect allocation. If the declaration is wrong, program will warn “Vouchers are not entered by cost aggregating object” when checking.
</p>
<p class="node">Factors to Define Coef.</p>
<p class="node_d">A cost factor can be allocated by integrating indicators into a general allocation article.</p>
 <p class="e">Following cost aggregation table for example:<br/>
When “Salary, Social Insurance” are selected to factor list for salary allocation formula, coefficient will be “” in the table above.<br/>
The factors in list will be separated by comma (,) or selected from list.</p><p id="pic"><img src="eng/factor3.png"/></p><br/>
<p class="node">Coefficient Defined by Arising/Cost</p>
<p class="node_d">Factors in list for cost allocation formula are considered to define by 1 in 2 following options:</p>
<ul class="lo_2">
1 - In period arising: cost increase in period<br/>
2 - Cost: costs calculated in this period production cost.</ul>
<p class="node">Posted to WIP Account</p>
<p class="node_d">The checkbox option, if activated, indicates that the cost calculated from advanced calculation function will be auto posted to WIP account.</p>

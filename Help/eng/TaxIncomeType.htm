<ul class="lo_2">
A01 - Income being salary (resident taxpayers with labor contracts in term of 3 months or over);<br/>
A02 - Income being salary (resident taxpayers without labor contracts or with ones in term of under 3 months);<br/>
B01 - Income being salary (non-resident taxpayers);<br/>
B02 - Business income with 1% tax rate (non-resident taxpayers);<br/>
B03 - Business income with 2% tax rate (non-resident taxpayers);<br/>
B04 - Business income with 5% tax rate (non-resident taxpayers);<br/>

</ul>
<p id="td2">	Field descriptions</p>
<p class="node">	PIT Type</p>
<p class="node_d">If this type is 1 – Progressive, assessable income will be calculated according to the scale of the progressive tax tariff. If this type is 2 – Entire, each type of income will be applied a specific tax rate.
<br/>See “Income/Deduction List” for more details.</p>
<p class="node">	Replacement Code</p>
<p class="node_d">Code used to replace income type according to the filter condition when running PIT finalization (1-Yes)
If the “Replace Income Type” option is 1 – Yes, the value of “Income Type” column arising will be replaced by this code. If there is no 
replacement code, income type will be the old one.
<br/>In case an employee has received income being salary deducted PIT by both the progressive tax and the flat rate tariff in a year:</p>
<p class="e">For example: <br/>
2 probation months with income (A02) deducted by flat rate tariff, 10 official working months with income (A01) deducted by the progressive 
tax tariff. The year-end finalization is calculated by the progressive tax tariff; only income code A01 will be used so income code A02 must 
be replaced by A01.

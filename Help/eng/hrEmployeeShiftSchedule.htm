<p id="td1">Employee Working Shift Schedule</p>
<p id="p1">It is required to schedule working shift of employees so that the system can recognize to which workday, shift the working 
time belongs.</p>

<p class="note">Note:<br/>
- If the timecard reports are viewed without data, you should check if the employee working shift has been scheduled or not.<br/>
- Beside regular working shifts, the overtime working shifts will also be defined in this function.<br/>
- The additional time or leave by regulation will be systematically added in time sheet, it is not required to schedule here.</p>

<p class="note">Other notes:<br/>
After defining working shift and details, you can have working shift and overtime scheduled to calculate regular and overtime working 
time in following cases:<br/>
- Case 1 – employee working shift schedule:<br/>
+ Regular working shift C1 with details CT1 &amp; CT2 (regular workday type);<br/>
+ Overtime working shift C2 with details CT3 &amp; CT4 (overtime workday type).<br/>
- Case 2 - employee regular and overtime working shift schedule:<br/>
+ Regular working shift C1 with details CT1 &amp; CT2 (regular workday type): working shift schedule;<br/>
+ Regular working shift C1 with details CT3 &amp; CT4 (overtime workday type): overtime schedule.<br/>
- Case 3 - employee overtime working shift schedule:<br/>
+ Regular working shift C1 with details CT1 &amp; CT2 (regular workday type);<br/>
+ Regular working shift C1 with details CT3 &amp; CT4 (overtime workday type).<br/>
In case 3, overtime shift is scheduled in the whole month including non-working days, only overtime on workdays will be calculated. If the 
employees have non-working day overtime, it’s required to separately schedule overtime shift on workdays and non-working days.</p>

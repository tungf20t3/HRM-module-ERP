<p id="td1">Output VAT Invoice Entry</p>
 <p id="p1">Path: Modules → General → Tax → Output VAT Invoice Entry <br/>

Beside available VAT tabs in data entry screens, “Input VAT Invoice Entry” menu is used in some special cases that VAT invoices are entered by staffs who are responsible for tax, instead of professional accountants, because of work assignment in Accounting department. </p>

<p id="td2">   Other notes</p>

<p id="p2">Some notes in output VAT voucher entry:
<ul class="lo_2">
- For correct and automatic VAT reports, the output VAT account must be divided into sub-accounts by the principles mentioned in Organization of Chart of Accounts.<br/>
- During sales invoice entry, only items in one tax rate are entered in an invoice. In case of an invoice includes items in many tax rates, these items must be classified and entered separately as different vouchers.<br/>

- For construction company with works located in a city/province different from one where tax declaration is submitted, output VAT must be divided into 2 parts: 7% paid to tax authority where tax is declared and 3% paid to locality where the work is located. This construction invoice is entered in service invoice by 2 rows with tax rates 7% and 3%. The revenue must not be entered in the 2nd row but tax amount (3%). These data will be transferred to output VAT listing in 2 rows and the revenue in 1st row (7%) will be taxable revenue of the whole invoice.<br/>
- For company paying tax in many tax authorities (example: construction company having works in many provinces/cities), tax accounts are declared as accounts payable/receivable, tax authorities are declared in Customer List. When recording in tax accounts, you must  define which tax authority is used for convenience in tracking and reporting detailed by tax authority.<br/>
- Customer name, address and tax code declared in Customer list will be automatically extracted to output VAT invoice listing when you key the customer ID. For retail customers who purchase once, you can group them in one code without address, tax code and name which will be entered during data entry.</ul>

<p id="p2">Output VAT accounting must obey following order:
<ul class="lo_2">
- Goods, services sales with VAT: Debit on account 131, 111, 112.../ Credit on account 333<br/>
- At the end of period, close and transfer the un-deducted VAT (if any): Debit on account 142, 632…/ Credit on account 133<br/>
- If the total payable output VAT amount is greater than the deductible one, transfer the total debit amount of account 133 to account 33311; on the contrary, if the total payable output VAT amount is less than the deductible one, transfer the total credit amount of account 33311 to account 133</ul>
<p id="p2">… to achieve the correct “VAT of goods, services sales in period” article in Tax Declaration.<br/>
In case of return to supplier, output VAT accounting must obey the following order:
<ul class="lo_2">
- When receiving returned goods, services: Debit on account 33313/ Credit on account 131;<br/>
- At the end of period, closing: Debit on account 33311/ Credit on account 33313…</ul>
<p id="p2">… to create VAT detail book of goods sales returned and post the sales returned goods VAT articles in some tax reports.</p>

<p class="note">
The "Invoice Form" field is default as one in optional parameter but editable.<br/>
This "Invoice Form" will be used in tax reports by the following priority:<br/>
- The "Invoice Form" input in voucher is the first priority;<br/>
- If this field is not defined in voucher, the system will get the "Default Output Invoice Form" in optional parameter;<br/>
- If the "Default Output Invoice Form" parameter is also blank, there will be no "Invoice Form" in tax reports.

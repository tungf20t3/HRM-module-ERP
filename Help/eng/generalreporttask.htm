<p id="td1">Some common guide in reports</p>
<p id="p1">
All report screens have some common tasks as follows:

<p class="node">Common tasks in date fields
<p class="node_d">
To input the date in data entry, we can directly key in or select from the system by clicking on the icon at the right of date fields.</p>
<p id="pic"><img src="eng\date_Lookup.png"/></p>

<p class="note">
In the calendar screen, we can select the day only. To choose the month, use the left and right arrows. To choose the year, click on “month, year” area (at the middle of 2 arrows). Thus, at the date field, we can select by following order:
<br/>
01. Date, month, year<br/>

02. Month, year<br/>

03. Year - 10 years<br/>

04. Month, year<br/>

05. Date, month, year</p><br/>

<p id="pic"><img src="eng\year_Lookup1.png"/></p> 
<p id="pic"><img src="eng\year_Lookup2.png"/></p> 
<p id="pic"><img src="eng\year_Lookup3.png"/></p> 

<p class="node">Filter condition – Fields selected from list

<br/>
To learn more about wildcard characters, please search by the key word “wildcard” for online document. </p>

<p class="tip"> 
- If you cannot remember both code and name, use quick search. Click the "<img src="eng\Lookup-ai_erp4.png"/>"  icon and then key the required characters in “Quick Search” box. <br/>
- If you remember code but name, you should search by field filter. Click "<img src="eng\Lookup-ai_erp4.png"/>", 
 icon and next click "<img src="eng\Cursor1.png"/>" icon in code field, and key in the required characters. </p><br/>

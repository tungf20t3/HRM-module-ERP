<p id="td1">Employee Leave by Regulation
<p id="p1">This function is used to input hours of leave by regulation of employees who have been working. 
If there is information input in this function, the system will add hours of leave by regulation to working hours in workday computation.
<p class="e">For example: <br>
- A female employee who has been back to work after maternity leave will be allowed 1-hour leave per day to take care of her child. 
This benefit will be effective until the child is 1 year old.<br>
- Employee whose home is far away from work can be allowed 1-hour early out per day to take shuttle to home.<br>
If the employee who has been defined the leave by regulation by does not go to work (there is no timekeeping data) 
will not be add this hour of leave.

<p class="node">Filter condition

<p id="pic"><img src="eng\hrEmployeeLeavebyRegulation1.png"></p>
<p class="node_d">Define the "Date from" field to filter the information of leave by regulation

<p class="e">For example: <br>
If you want to view the information of 1-hour leave from 01 Jan 2014 to 30 Jun 2014, define the "Date from" as 01 Jan 2014 or before.

<p class="node">Shift Schedule

<p id="pic"><img src="eng\hrEmployeeLeavebyRegulation2.png"></p>
<p class="node_d">In case of leave by regulation, it is required to define a working shift shorter than the regular one so that the total number of working hours and leaving hours after workday computation will not over the regular working hours. This special working shift will be systematically calculated.

<p class="e">For example: <br>
A female employee works in office shift from 8:00 to 17:00 (8 working hours), she is allowed 1-hour leave to take care of her new-born child 
from January to June. In this case, it is required to define and input as following:<br> 
 - An office shift (XX) from 8:00 to 16:00 or from 9:00 to 17:00 (7 working hours);<br>
 - Schedule this shift for that employee from January to June;<br>
 - Input "Employee Leave by Regulation" with shift XX;<br>
 - That employee will have timekeeping time following the scheduled shift XX.<br>
At that time, if that employee has timekeeping time over the working hours defined in shift XX, the system will only record 8 working hours.

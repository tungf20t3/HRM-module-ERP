<p id="td1">Lot Maintenance</p>
<p id="p1">Lot maintenance is designed for stock controlling by lot purpose.</p>
<p id="pic"><img src="eng/lot.png"/></p>
<p id="td2">Field descriptions</p>
<p class="node">Item</p>
<p class="node_d">Item received in lot; an item can be received in many lots if there is check in “Lot control” option in Item List.</p>
<p class="node">Receipt Date</p>
<p class="node_d">The date when the lot is received</p>
<p class="node">Manufacturing Date</p>
<p class="node_d">More information about the date when the item is manufactured</p>
<p class="node">Expiry Date</p>
<p class="node_d">The date when the item’s useful life is expired; if the lot assignment in Item List is “When received” option, the expiry date will be equal to receipt date plus “useful life (days)” of item.</p>
<p class="node">Warranty Date</p>
<p class="node_d">Warranty date of item will be system-generated by adding “warranty days” to receipt date.<br/>
If the lot assignment in Item List is “When used” option, the expiry date and warranty date must be manually input.</p>

<p id="td2">Create lot during voucher entry
<p id="p2"> If the item is checked in “Lot Control” (in Item List), you can define lot information in this “Lot Maintenance”. 
Besides, lot can be created during data entries of following vouchers:<br/>
<ul class="lo_2">
- Domestic Purchase Invoice;<br/>
- Import Purchase Invoice;<br/>
- Purchase Receipt – Direct Issue Voucher;<br/>
- Receipt</ul>
<p id="p2"> If the item is checked in “Lot Control” and “Allow creating lot when receiving” options (in Item List), 
the system will auto-generate lot code in the format defined in "Automatic Lot Code" parameter to put in the voucher.<br/>
<p id="pic"><img src="eng/Lot1.png"/></p>
<p id="p2">
In voucher entry screen (grid view), click the icon <img src="eng\Lotgenerate.png"/> - “Lot maintenance” to open “Lot maintenance” screen. 
This screen will only show the detail lines of items with "Auto creating lot when receiving" option and the current code of lot is incorrect.
If the “Lot” typed in detail does not exist, the system will auto generate lot code by the rule defined in system parameters. <br/>
Lots are generated by the format defined the “Automatic Lot Code” parameter with 04 special characters “d,m,y,#”:
<ul class="lo_2">
- "d" stands for day;<br/>
- "m" stands for month;<br/>
- "y" stands for year;<br/>
- "#" stands for ordinal number (auto increase in case of multi-lot receiving in a day).</ul>
<p id="p2">
The character “dmy” must be lower case, if they are in upper case, the system will understand as a part of lot code. 
<p class="e">
Example: <br/>We configured the parameter “Automatic Lot Code” as “LO.ddmmyyyy.##” 
In the day Oct 15th 2012 we have 2 receipts, the first one will have lot ID as  “LO.15102012.01”, and the second one will have lot ID as “LO.15102012.02”.
<p id="p2">Other related information:<br/>
- Receipt Date: being default as voucher date in the first data entry, but editable;<br/>
- Lot Description: system-generated in the form of Lot + lot ID + [Receipt Date] + voucher date, but editable;<br/>
- Manufacturing Date: being default as Receipt Date, but editable;<br/>
- Expiry Date: being equal to "Receipt Date" plus "Shelf Life Days" (if the "Assignment" is "1 - When Received");<br/>
- Warranty Date: being equal to "Receipt Date" plus "Warranty Days", but editable.

<p class="note">Note: <br/>
After you press “OK” in “Lot maintenance” form, a new lot has been created in the list although the voucher has not been saved yet. 
Therefore, when editing an unfinished voucher, you should manually input the created code of lot to avoid creating another code in the system. 

<p id="td2"> Some tasks in list maintenance

<p class="node"> Import data from excel file
<p class="node_d">
The system is enabled to import data from excel spreadsheet to save hours of manual effort.<br/>
The data importing process:
<ul class="lo_2">
	- Enter List;<br/>
	- Click the icon <img src="eng/download.png"/> to download template file to put data in;<br/>
	- After keying data in the spreadsheet, to up data to the system, click the icon <img src="eng/upload.png"/>, 
	select the file, the system will get data from this file to List.<br/>
</ul>

<p class="note">Notes of inputting data in template file:<br/>
- Item Code: check the existence in Item List;<br/>
- Item and lot: check the existence of these 2 codes in Lot Maintenance; if the input codes already exist in Lot Maintenance, the system will replace by one in the template file (if the copy type is "Overwrite"). The new codes are certainly added to List. The length of code is the same as one in add (edit) screen;<br/>
- Receipt Date, Manufacturing Date, Warranty Date, Expiry Date: input in date format;<br/>
- Description, Other Name, Part Number: manually input with the same length as one in add (edit) screen.
</p>

<p class="note">The system will give error message in some following cases:<br/>
	- Data in columns containing codes of related objects do not exist in current lists. 
	In this case, the system will indicate the specific invalid cell;<br/>
	- String data is longer than the available length of field;<br/>
	- Invalid data type (for example: 1,0 or yes/no), in this case, the system indicate the specific invalid cell;<br/>
	- Duplicate or nested codes, in this case, the system indicate the specific invalid cell.

<p class="note">Other notes:<br/>
- If you do not have the "New" right in "Lot Maintenance", you cannot import new data from spreadsheet to this list;<br/>
- If you do not have the "Edit" right in "Lot Maintenance", you cannot edit data in this list from spreadsheet.

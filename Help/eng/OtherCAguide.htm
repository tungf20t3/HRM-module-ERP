<p id="td2">Deal with coincident entries related to cash and bank deposit</p>
<p id="td3">Classify transactions having coincident entries</p>

<p id="p3">In many cases, there can be 2 vouchers having coincident entries in an accounting transaction. The following are some common 
transactions:</p>

<ul class="lo_2">
- Pay cash to bank: having Cash Disbursement and Bank Credit Advice.<br/>
- Withdraw cash from bank deposit account: having Bank Debit Advice and Cash Receipt.<br/>
- Transfer cash from bank A to bank B: having Debit Advice of bank A and Credit Advice of bank B.<br/>
- Purchase goods, materials by cash payment: having Cash Disbursement and goods Receipt.<br/>
- Sell goods, materials for cash receipt: having Sales Invoice and Cash Receipt.</ul>

<p id="p3">In each case, 2 vouchers have coincident charts of entry but controlled by 2 different accountants so there can be different
 information. For example, in selling for cash receipt, Sales Invoices are created by sale accountant, which contain information 
 of quantity, unit price, amount of goods; Cash Receipts are created by cash accountant and there is only total amount of goods 
 sold. Therefore, there should be clear process of entering and handling vouchers in computer. If there is consideration of transactions
  having coincident entry, they can be divided into groups:</p>

<p class="node">Transactions related to cash and bank deposit</p>
<ul class="lo_2">
- 1- Pay cash to bank<br/>
- 2- Withdraw cash from bank deposit account<br/>
- 3- Transfer cash among banks<br/>
- 4- Purchase foreign currency<br/>
- 5- Sell foreign currency.</ul>
<p class="node">Transactions related to goods, materials purchase and sale by cash or bank deposit</p>
<ul class="lo_2">
- 1- Purchase goods, materials by cash or bank deposit<br/>
- 2- Sell goods, materials for cash or bank deposit</ul>
<p class="node">Transactions related to payment in advance for goods, materials purchase</p>
<ul class="lo_2">
- Payment in advance for goods, materials purchase</ul>
<p class="node">Transactions related to services supply for immediate receipt</p>
<ul class="lo_2">
- Supply services for immediate receipt (hotel, restaurant, tourism...)</ul>

<p id="td3">
Coincident entry between cash and bank deposit </p>

<p class="node">
Method 1: Input only 1 voucher – Disbursement or bank voucher</p>
<p class="node_d">In case there is coincident entry related to both cash and bank deposit, only 1 in 2 vouchers should be input in
 computer by following priority:</p>

<ul class="lo_2">
- The priority of voucher in foreign currency is higher than that in VND.<br/>
- The priority of cash is higher than that of bank deposit.<br/>
- In case of transfer cash between 2 banks, the priority of Debit Advice (Disbursement) is higher than that of Credit Advice (Receipt).</ul>
<p class="node_d">By this priority, vouchers are selected to input in practical cases as following:</p>


<p id="pic"><img src="eng/OtherCAguide1.png"/></p>


<p class="node">
Method 2: Input both 2 vouchers through an intermediate account – Money in Transit</p>
<p class="node_d">
If we want to input all 2 vouchers, we must use an intermediate account – 113 – Money in Transit. However, it will make amount
 in this account increase.</p>

<p id="td3">
Coincident entry related to goods purchase and sale for immediate payment</p>

<p id="p3">
In cases of cash and materials as materials purchase and sale for cash payment, vouchers of cash and materials contain different
 information so there will be different solutions to enter these vouchers. Choose solution that is appropriate to enterprise’s background.</p>
<p class="node">
Method 1: Input both 02 vouchers but there is no entry for voucher of materials</p>
<p class="node_d">
In this solution, both 02 vouchers are input but voucher of materials is not controlled in debit/credit. It only supports goods, materials
 sites management. Data used to create entry reports are extracted from receipt/disbursement vouchers.</p>
<p class="node">
Method 2: Entry by AP/AR Account</p>
<p class="node_d">
In this solution, purchase and sale is for immediate payment but entry is the same as that for deferred payment purchase and
 sale. Both 02 vouchers of receipt/disbursement and materials are input.<br/>

This is the simplest solution but there is a disadvantage that we do not know which is immediate or deferred payment when viewing entry.</p>
<p id="td3">
Coincident entry related to services supply for immediate receipt </p>
<p id="p3">
In case of supply services for immediate receipt (hotel, restaurant, tourism...), there will be 2 voucher: sales invoice and cash
 receipt. There are 3 methods to input vouchers in this case.</p>
<p class="node">
Method 1: Input both 2 vouchers – Enter in AP/AR Account</p>
<p class="node_d">
Both 2 vouchers are input through receivable account.</p>
<p class="node">
Method 2: Input both 2 vouchers – Enter in Cash Account</p>
<p class="node_d">
Information in Sales Invoice will be transferred to output VAT invoice list.<br/>
Information in Cash Receipt will be transferred to General Ledger to record in book and create accounting reports.</p>

<p id="td2">
Exchange Rate Difference related to Cash and Bank Deposit</p>
<p id="td3">
Declare exchange rate difference for foreign currency account</p>

<p id="p3">
If the account is original FC account, in Chart of Accounts, you have to define FC code different from base currency. Then, the
 system will require book rate calculating method to base to create difference entry arising in period. You can define different methods
  for each FC account.</p>

<p id="pic"><img src="eng/OtherCAguide2.png"/></p>
<p id="p3">

Some descriptions of exchange rate difference calculating methods</p>
<p class="node">
Exchange Rate Type (Liability)</p>
<p class="node_d">Used to define book exchange rate calculating method for capital account in foreign currency</p>
<p class="node">Exchange Rate Type (Asset)</p>
<p class="node_d">Used to define book exchange rate calculating method for asset account in foreign currency</p>
<p class="node">Exchange Rate Type= 0 -  None</p>
<p class="node_d">Book rates of all arising transactions related to foreign currency in period are user-defined and manually
 input. The system will not calculate book rate but will support creating difference entry (if any).</p>
<p class="node">Exchange Rate Type=1 - Monthly average</p>
<p class="node_d">In this method, opening balance and all arising amounts in month of the required objects will be used to calculate 
book exchange rate. The required objects consist of: “Account – FC code”, “Account – FC code – Customer (Supplier)”. Arising making 
these object decrease will have the same book rate that is system-generated and auto-created difference entry (if any).</p>
<p class="node">Exchange Rate Type=2 - Specific</p>
<p class="node_d">In this method, book rate of required objects will be user-defined and updated in arising vouchers in the 
system. The system will base on this specific book rate to create difference entry (if any).</p>
<p class="node">Exchange Rate Type=3 - FIFO</p>
<p class="node_d">In this method, exchange rate in vouchers having earliest posting date will be calculated first and auto-created
 difference entry (if any). </p>
<p class="node">Exchange Rate Type= 4 - Moving average</p>
<p class="node_d">The same as monthly average method, the only difference is daily average.</p>

<p id="td3">
Declare exchange rate difference account for FC code</p>
<p id="pic"><img src="eng/OtherCAguide3.png"/></p>

<p id="p3">
It is required to declare account needed entering first if there is exchange rate difference. The system allows declaring profit
 and loss account, exchange rate difference of each type of currency.</p>

<p id="td2">
Apply monthly average method in the system</p>
<p class="node">
Application field:</p>
<p class="node_d">
This method is only used in foreign currency receipt, disbursement transactions code 1 – “Disbursement detailed by invoice” and 
code 5 – “FC Receipt with Average Book Rate” (payment by customer/supplier) and other FC vouchers (if any).</p>
<p class="node">Formula:</p>
<p class="node_d">Consider: (i) – FC code, (j) – account and (k) – AP/AR object, general formula of average exchange rate will be:<br/>
Require object is “Account – FC code”:</p>

<p id="pic"><img src="eng/OtherCAguide4.png"/></p>

<p class="node_d">Require object is “Account - FC code – Customer (Supplier)”:
</p>

<p id="pic"><img src="eng/OtherCAguide5.png"/></p>

<p class="node_d">
In the formula above, “specific” decrease amounts are defined as following cases:</p>
<ul class="lo_2">
●	Receipt/disbursement voucher type 1 - “Disbursement detailed by invoice”;<br/>
●	Receipt/disbursement voucher type 2 - “Disbursement to Supplier” with “Edit Book Ex. Rate” option activated;<br/>
●	Receipt/disbursement voucher type 5 - “FC Receipt with Average Book Rate” with “Edit Book Ex. Rate” option activated;<br/>
●	Loss for exchange rate difference at the end of month (voucher code PK6) for balance revaluation (debit of capital account or credit of asset account – because of monthly average book rate calculation at the end of month);<br/>
●	Reversing entries of exchange rate difference entries at period-opening.</ul>

<p class="node">
Data entry:</p>

<ul class="lo_2">
- Receipt (Bank Credit Advice) voucher type1: input the transaction exchange rate in format view (general information). Transaction rate is the average rate among banks defined by State bank or the actual exchange rate in FC buying/selling transactions with banks (if any). <br/>
- Disbursement (Bank Debit Advice) voucher type 2: do not input any exchange rate, it will be system-generated. <br/>
- Disbursement (Bank Debit Advice) voucher type 5: input the transaction exchange rate in format view <br/>
- Other FC vouchers (if any): input the transaction exchange rate in format view.</ul>
<p class="node_d">
To Receipt voucher type1, the system will auto create the difference entry after comparing the transaction exchange rate in format view and one in invoice.<br/>
To Disbursement voucher type 2, the system will auto calculate temporary book rate at payment time in format view and create temporary difference entry after comparing with exchange rate in invoice.<br/>
To Disbursement voucher type 5, the system will not create the difference entry at payment time but at the end of period, after running
 “Book Exchange Rate”  function.</p>

<p class="note">
Note: <br/>
To receipt, disbursement voucher type 1 and 5, if you want to input specific book rate, check in “Edit Book Ex. Rate” option.</p>

<p class="node">
Period-end process</p>
<p class="node_d">
At the end of period, run “Book Exchange Rate” function in “Cash Management/ Data Entry”.</p>
<ul class="lo_2">
- 1st time: check in “Update Booked Ex. Rate again” option so that the system will recalculate differences of receipt, disbursement 
voucher type 1.<br/>
- 2nd time: do not check in “Update Booked Ex. Rate again” option so that the system will calculate book rate and create difference
 transaction for receipt, disbursement voucher type 5 and other FC vouchers (if any).</ul>
<p class="note">
Note:<br/>
In case of receiving advance from customer or paying advance to supplier, you have to use voucher type 5, recorded by transaction
 exchange rate and check in “Edit Book Ex. Rate” option.<br/>
The same data entry for other transactions such as: cash transfer between banks, cash withdraw, cash deposit, collateral,... </p>

<p id="td2">
Apply moving average method in the system</p>
<p id="p2">
The same arguments as one in monthly average method. There are some different points: </p>
<ul class="lo_2">

- Average cost is calculated for each disbursement voucher instead of accumulation to month-end; <br/>
- Difference entry (if any) is created at the end of month instead of for each voucher</ul>
<p id="td2">
Apply FIFO method in the system</p>
<p class="node">
Application field:</p>
<p class="node_d">This method is only applied to foreign currency receipt, disbursement voucher type 1 – “Disbursement 
detailed by invoice”, type 2 – “Disbursement by customer/supplier” and type 9 – “Other”.</p>
<p class="node">Formula:</p>
<p class="node_d">The exchange rate input first will be priority to calculate book rate when issuing. In case foreign currency 
is issued in bulk and many receipts are used, book rate is calculated by weighted average among these receipts.</p>
<p class="node">
Data entry:</p>

<ul class="lo_2">
- Receipt (Bank Credit Advice) voucher type 1, 2, 9: input transaction exchange rate in format view. The book rate in grid view – detail
 information (if any) will be system-generated.<br/>
- Disbursement (Bank Debit Advice) voucher type 1, 2: do not input any exchange rate, the system will auto-generate. <br/>
- Disbursement (Bank Debit Advice) voucher type 9: input transaction exchange rate in format view in “Ex. Rate” field only, “Book Rate” will
 be system-generated.</ul>
<p class="node_d">In this method, book rate and exchange rate difference will be system-generated during data entry. However, it
 is necessary to have “Book Exchange Rate” function run and recalculate the exchange rate difference for the correct data.</p>

<p class="note">
Note: <br/>
To receipt, disbursement voucher type 1, 2 and 9, if you want to input specific book rate, check in “Edit Book Ex. Rate” option.<br/>
However, in FIFO method, <strong>specific exchange rate should not be used</strong> because the system will use the latest voucher exchange rate (increase) multiplied by total decrease amount to have the required total amount. The remaining amount will be calculated in the latest voucher. <br/>
This leads to the case if the specific payment voucher has exchange rate and base currency amount so huge; and if the latest payment
 voucher has small base currency amount, the remaining amount will be so small or even negative. See the example below for clear
  explanation about this. </p>

 <p class="e">
Example of limited use of specific exchange rate in FIFO method.<br/>
Payment voucher 1: 1.000$ 20.000.000 <br/>
Exchange rate and amount of voucher 1: 100$*25.000=2.500.000 (specific)<br/>
Exchange rate and amount of voucher 2: 1$=((100+1) *20.000 - 2.500.000)/(101-100)=-480.000/1=-480.000 <br/>
The exchange rate in this case is negative. </p>

<p class="node">
Period-end process</p>
<p class="node_d">
At the end of period, have “Book Exchange Rate” function in “Cash Management/ Data Entry” run once and check in “Edit Book Ex. Rate” option
 in data filter condition.</p>

<p class="note">
Note:<br/>
In case of receiving advance from customer or paying advance to supplier, use voucher type 2, recorded by transaction exchange rate (in both general and detail information) and check in “Edit Book Ex. Rate” option. <br/>
The same data entry for other transactions such as: cash transfer between banks, cash withdraw, cash deposit, collateral,... </p>

<p id="td2">
Apply specific exchange rate method in the system</p>
<p class="node">
Application field:</p>
<p class="node_d">This method is only applied to foreign currency receipt, disbursement voucher type 1 – “Disbursement detailed 
by invoice”, type 2 – “Disbursement for customer/supplier” and type 9 – “Other”. </p>
<p class="node">
Formula:</p>
<p class="node_d">The book exchange rate will be manually calculated and input it in the system. This is considered as specific book 
rate and will not be recalculated. The system will base on this rate to create exchange rate difference (if any). </p>
<p class="node">
Data entry:</p>

<ul class="lo_2">
- Receipt (Bank Credit Advice) voucher type 1, 2, 9: input transaction exchange rate in format view. The book rate in grid view (if any) will be user-defined and input.<br/>
- Disbursement (Bank Debit Advice) voucher type 1: book rate of cash account is user-defined and input in format view.<br/>
- Disbursement (Bank Debit Advice) voucher type 2: book rates of cash account and receivable/payable account are user-defined and input in format view and grid view.<br/>
- Disbursement (Bank Debit Advice) voucher type 9: input transaction exchange rate in format view in “Ex. Rate” field, “Book Rate” field
 (book rate of cash account) will be user-defined.</ul>
<p class="node_d">
In this method, the exchange rate difference will be system-generated right during data entry.</p>

</p>
<p id="td3">System</p>
<p class="node_d">System has been related to Sales Management in Sales Department List; therefore, department list is used for both two modules.
</p>
<p id="td3">General Ledger</p>

</p>
<ul class="lo_2">

<br/>-	Voucher Entry
<br/>Some sales data (Sales Invoice, Receivable Vouchers, Sales Return…) saved in Sales Management will be kept processing or directly posted to ledger in General Ledger. It depends on status of vouchers when saved. General Ledger can intervene in original vouchers in Sales Management if it is given competence to adjust voucher.
</ul>
<p id="td3">Inventory Management</p>

<br/>
-	Is invoice created by Sales or Accounting department? 
</ul>
<p class="node_d">Supposing that the process in your business is creating pick list before invoicing, accountant will create invoice by getting data from pick list. The process will be: 
</p>
<ul class="lo_2">
-	Sales – Pick List;
<br/>
-	Accountant – Invoice transaction code 3 – Invoice.
</ul>
<p class="node_d">Supposing that the process in your business is immediate invoicing, the process will be: </p>
<ul class="lo_2">

</ul>

<p id="td1">Employee Overtime Register</p>

<p id="p1">It is required to register overtime shift for employees so that the system can recognize to which workday and shift 
the overtime time belongs. If the timecard reports are viewed without data, you should check if the employee overtime shift (or 
shift schedule with overtime workday) has been registered or not.</p>

<p class="node">	Date from/to</p>
<p class="node_d">
It’s possible to have overtime registered once in a period (from day to day). However, if the overtime is not continuous, you 
have to input by day.</p>

<p class="node"> Minimum Minutes/ Maximum Hours</p>
<p class="node_d"> Minimum minutes and maximum hours of detailed shift defined in “Detailed Shift” and “Employee overtime register”.</p>

<ul class="lo_2">
- If the calculated “hours” (regular or overtime working) plus “added minutes” is greater than “Maximum Hours”, it will be equal 
to “Maximum Hours”;<br/>
- If the calculated “hours” (regular or overtime working) is less than “Minimum Minutes”, it will be 0 and not be added “Late in, 
early out” minutes or “Added minutes” of this detailed shift.</ul>
<p class="note">
The minimum minutes and maximum hours in working shift schedule have higher priority than ones in detailed shift. This is used for:<br/>
+ overtime register with detailed shift: regular and overtime working day;<br/>
+ overtime register without detailed shift: overtime working day.</p>
<p class="e">
After defining working shift and details, you can have working shift and overtime scheduled to calculate regular and overtime 
working time in following cases:<br/>
- Case 1 – employee working shift schedule:<br/>
+ Regular working shift C1 with details CT1 &amp; CT2 (regular workday type);<br/>
+ Overtime working shift C2 with details CT3 &amp; CT4 (overtime workday type).<br/>
- Case 2 - employee regular and overtime working shift schedule:<br/>
+ Regular working shift C1 with details CT1 &amp; CT2 (regular workday type): working shift schedule;<br/>
+ Regular working shift C1 with details CT3 &amp; CT4 (overtime workday type): overtime schedule.<br/>
- Case 3 - employee overtime working shift schedule:<br/>
+ Regular working shift C1 with details CT1 &amp; CT2 (regular workday type);<br/>
+ Regular working shift C1 with details CT3 &amp; CT4 (overtime workday type).<br/>
In case 3, overtime shift is scheduled in the whole month including non-working days, only overtime on workdays will be 
calculated. If the employees have non-working day overtime, it’s required to separately schedule overtime shift on workdays and 
non-working days.</p>

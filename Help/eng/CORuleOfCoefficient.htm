<p id="td1"> Setup Rule of Coefficient</p>

<p id="p1">In menu “Set up Coefficient of Distribution”, we have defined distribution coefficients. In general case, costs are distributed to all aggregating objects by that coefficient.<br/>
In special case, if there are some objects receiving that cost, it is difficult to carry out the distribution by coefficient in menu “Set up Coefficient of Distribution”. At that time, we should use menu “Set up Rule of Coefficient” to limit.<br/>

 <p class="e">Example:<br/>
There are 10 workshops producing 1 same product, only 1 
workshop has not spent finished goods stored expense because there is local site there. 
All other 9 workshops must spend these expenses. There are 2 ways to enter data:<br/>
- Detail cost vouchers of 9 workshops and monthly post in general ledger as these details;<br/>
- Only entry for 1 total number of all workshops, then declare once for other 9 workshops in menu “set up Rule of Coefficient”.<br/>

<p id="p1">Before, it takes long time to separately define a cost factor for each product. The system now supports to do it quickly by “New rule of coefficient for multi-factor and multi-product” function.<br/>
This function helps to define mass of cost factors for many products. The system will base on the combination of information defined in entry screen – usually cost factor and product – to create mass of allocation details for product.</p>

<p id="td2">         Field Descriptions</p>
<p class="node">Period / Year</p>
<p class="node_d">Period / Year are closing time, defined by order from the beginning of fiscal year.</p>
<p class="node">Factor Code</p>
<p class="node_d">Code of cost factor having coefficient of distribution</p>
<p class="node">Indirect Dept.</p>
<p class="node_d">It is used as intermediary section to distribute to other sections.</p>
<p class="node">Department</p>
<p class="node_d">Code of production line, workshop defined to receive distributed cost</p>
<p class="node">MO Number</p>
<p class="node_d">Number of MO defined to receive distributed cost</p>
<p class="node">Product</p>
<p class="node_d">Code of product defined to receive distributed cost</p>

<p id="td2">Import data from excel file</p>
<p id="p2">The system is enabled to import data from excel spreadsheet to save hours of manual effort.</p>
<p class="node">The data importing process:</p>
<p class="node_d">
	- Enter "Setup Rule of Coefficient" menu;<br/>
	- Click the icon <img src="eng/download.png"/> to download template file to put data in;<br/>
	- After keying data in the spreadsheet, to up data to the system, click the icon <img src="eng/upload.png"/>, 
	select the file, the system will get data from this file into the system.<br/>

<p class="note">Notes of inputting data in template file:<br/>
- Factor Code, Product, Indirect Department, Department, MO Number: must be one existing in the corresponding lists (Cost Factor List, Item List, Section List, Manufacturing Order) with the same length in add (edit) screen in list;<br/>
- Indirect Department: must be one existing in Section List, which is not checked in "Direct" option;<br/>
- Department, MO Number: are optional fields depending on structure of the costing problem;<br/>
- Product: user-defined information, 128 characters maximum.
</p>
	
<p class="note">Other notes:<br/>
- Cannot import data after system data closing date (the data closing date after the beginning input date);<br/>
- The current user must have the "Edit" right in this function to update the available data in the system (Copy type 1 - Overwrite);<br/>
- The current user must have the "New" right in this function to add new data to the system (Copy type 1 - No);<br/>
- Cannot import data from spreadsheet with macro;<br/>
- Only support for spreadsheet in Excel 2007 or higher.

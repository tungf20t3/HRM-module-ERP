same time.<br/>
- If the user (already sign in) wants to sign in another computer (or browser), it is required to sign out; <br/>
- Closing the browser does not mean signing out the system. At that time, you have to wait for working session finish

- If the user wants to sign in another client (or browser), the system will ask if the user want to sign out the current session 
or not. If yes, the previous session will be completely invalidated.</p>

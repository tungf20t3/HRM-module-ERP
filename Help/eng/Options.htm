</p>
<ul class="lo_2">
- “By day”: FIFO for each issue voucher daily. If the quantity in an FIFO issue voucher is bigger than the remained quantity in warehouse,

</ul>
<p class="node">

<p class="node">Automatic Lot Code</p>
<p class="node_d">
About Auto lot generation tool:<br/>
If the item is checked in “Lot Control” and “Allow creating lot when receiving” options (in Item List), it is unnecessary to define lot 
information in
 “Lot Maintenance”. Lot can be defined during data entries of following vouchers.</p>
<ul class="lo_2">
- Domestic Purchase Invoice;<br/>
- Import Purchase Invoice;<br/>
- Purchase Receipt – Direct Issue Voucher;<br/>
- Receipt
</ul>
<p class="node_d">
AI ERP supports auto lot generation. User inputs item in detail grid, then click on - “Lot maintenance” to open
 “Lot maintenance” form. 
This form will show grid lines for items with auto lot definition and lot IDs wrongly shown. If “Lot ID” typed in detail does not exist, 
the system will 
auto generate lot id by the rule defined in system parameters. Lots are generated by “Automatic Lot Code”: the system uses 04 characters 
 “d,m,y,#” with replacement as follows: </p>

<ul class="lo_2">
- "d" for day;
<br/>- "m" for month;
<br/>- "y" for year;
<br/>- # for ordinal number (auto increase In case of multi-lot receiving in a day).
</ul>
<p class="e">Example: <br/>
We configured the parameter “Automatic Lot Code” as “LO.ddmmyyyy.##” In the day Oct 15th 2012 we have 2 receipts, the first will generate 
lot ID as
 “LO.15102012.01”, and the second will generate lot ID as “LO.15102012.02”. </p>
<p class="note">
Note: <br/>
After user presses “OK” in “Lot maintenance” form, a new lot is created although the voucher has not been saved yet. Therefore, do not
 use Auto lot 
function when editing open vouchers to avoid new lot ID; key in lot ID manually in this case.

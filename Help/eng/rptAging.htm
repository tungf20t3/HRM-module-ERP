<p class="node"> Date to 
<p class="node_d">This is base to define the payment to invoice of payment vouchers with the voucher date before or the same as the date in this field.

<p class="node">Due Date 
<p class="node_d">This is base to list the invoices with invoice date before due date and to define if the invoices are available or overdue and the number of overdue days.

<p class="node">Days of Period 
<p class="node_d">This field is used to split overdue invoices in columns, to define number of days that the invoices are overdue.

<p class="e">For example: <br/>
+ Invoice HD1 dated 01 May 2013, payment term as 30 days, invoice amount as VND 30,000,000;<br/>
+ On 15 May 2013, there is Cash Receipt PT1 receiving payment for this invoice as VND 10,000,000;<br/>
+ On 25 May 2013, there is another Cash Receipt PT2 receiving payment for this invoice as VND 15,000,000.<br/>
<p class="e">
-	If you select to view report by the "Date to" as 20 May 2013, "Due Date" as 15 May 2013, "Days of Period" as 20 days.<br/>
The report will be shown with invoice HD1 with invoice amount as VND 30,000,000;<br/>
Received amount is VND 10,000,000 (amount in Cash Receipt PT1 dated 15 May 2013 - before the "Date to" 20 May 2013);<br/>
Receivable amount will be VND 30,000,000 - 10,000,000 = 20,000,000. The due date of this amount will be 31 May 2013, after the "Due Date" 15 May 2013 so this invoice is available.

<p class="e">
-	If you select to view report by the "Date to" as 15 June 2013, "Due Date" as 30 June 2013, "Days of Period" as 20 days.<br/>
The report will be shown with invoice HD1 with invoice amount as VND 30,000,000;<br/>
Received amount is VND 25,000,000 (amount in Cash Receipt PT1 and PT2 dated 15 May 2013 and 25 May 2013 - before the "Date to" 15 June 2013);<br/>
Receivable amount will be VND 30,000,000 - 25,000,000 = 5,000,000. The due date of this amount is 31 May 2013, before the "Due Date" 30 June 2013 so this invoice is 30-day overdue. Therefore, the amount VND 5,000,000 will be shown in the column "Overdue from 21 to 40 days". (The "Days of Period" is 20 so the columns of overdue days will be 1 - 20, 21 - 40...)

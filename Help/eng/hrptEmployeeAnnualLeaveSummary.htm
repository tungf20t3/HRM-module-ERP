<p id="p2">This report is used to show number of annual leave of employees by the date in filter condition.</p>

<p class ="node">Seniority</p>
<p class="node_d">
Seniority of an employee is calculated from join date of that employee. If the seniority is equal to  
"year of seniority to be added a day of annual leave" parameter, that employee will be added a day of annual leave.</p>

<p class ="e">For example:<br/>
An employee with Join Date as 01 Jan 2008, year of seniority to be added a day of annual leave is 5.<br/>
View report on 01 Jan 2013, that employee has 5 years of seniority and is added 1 day in the "Available" annual leave.<br/>
View report on 31 Dec 2012, that employee has 4.997 years of seniority and is not added 1 day in the "Available" annual leave.</p>


<p class ="node">Opening</p>
<p class="node_d">
- In case there is no “Due Date” defined in “Carried Forward Annual Leave Declaration”, the opening number of annual leave will be one 
defined in “Annual Leave Balance Input”. <br/>
- In case there is “Due Date” defined in “Carried Forward Annual Leave Declaration”:<br/>
+ If “Report Date” is before or the same as “Due Date”, the opening number of annual leave will be one defined in “Annual Leave Balance 
Input”;<br/>
+ If “Report Date” is after “Due Date”, the opening number of annual leave will be 0.
</p>

<p class ="node">Available</p>
<p class="node_d">
Number of annual leave available in year is sum of "Number of Annual Leaves in Year" and number of annual leaves input in "Employee 
Annual Leave Input",
"Department Additional Annual Leave Input" and "Employee Additional Annual Leave Input".</p>

<p class ="node">Used Leaves</p>
<p class="node_d">
Number of used leaves will be calculated as followings:<br/>
- In case there is no “Due Date” defined in “Carried Forward Annual Leave Declaration”, it is equal to one in workday computation 
result (from Employee Leave Input with workday sign as one defined in "Annual Leave Sign" parameter, which is also viewed in Employee Annual Leave Detailed Report) 
plus “Used Annual Leave” in “Annual Leave Balance Input”.<br/>
- In case there is “Due Date” defined in “Carried Forward Annual Leave Declaration”:<br/>
+ If “Report Date” is before or the same as “Due Date”, the number of used leaves will be equal to one in workday computation 
result plus “Used Annual Leave” in “Annual Leave Balance Input”.<br/>
+ If “Report Date” is before or the same as “Due Date”, the number of used leaves will be equal to A plus B plus C. With:<br/>
A = used annual leave from “Due Date” backward minus one in “Annual Leave Balance Input”. It is not allowed negative number;<br/>
B = used annual leave after “Due Date”;<br/>
C = “Used Annual Leave” in “Annual Leave Balance Input”.
</p>

<p class ="node">Remaining</p>
<p class="node_d">
Remaining number of annual leave equals opening number plus available in year minus the used number.</p>
